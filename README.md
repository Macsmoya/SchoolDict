# Māori Dictionary app 
Conceptual Statement
In this task you have been asked to design and implement a relational database linked to a website using python / sql that will allow teachers throughout New Zealand to collaboratively contribute to an illustrated online Te Reo dictionary.  At this point students won’t be allowed to add / edit the dictionary but the site should be created so that this functionality could be added at a later point if desired.

Design Brief
Te Reo is an official language in New Zealand and building vocabulary in young students can be facilitated by means of an illustrated English / Te Reo dictionary.  This dictionary should include vocabulary separated into broad topics such as time, animals, food, school etc.  When entries are made, the date should be recorded and each entry should include the year level at which the word is first encountered (from year 1 - year 10), and the author of the addition should be recorded.
